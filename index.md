## 1. Why guinea pigs and markdown are awesome?

Guinea pigs have positive energy and are beautiful. That's why we're writing this document about them. Also, we're learning the beautiful art of markdown.

Guinea pigs often say:
> _Pigs are great. Humans too, when they have tasty snacks to give us._

What health issues can they have?

- Problems with teeth
- Problems with fur and skin
- Digestive issues
- Parasites

That's why it is always important to observe your guinea pigs and weigh them regularly! :)

1. Water and hay
2. Vegetables
3. Vitamin C

## 5. Pigs in a table

| Guinea pig breed | Type of fur                         | Lifespan         |
| :---------------- | :-----------------------------------: | ----------------: |
| Peruvian         | long and silky, messy               | 4-7 years        |
| Alpaca           | short and thick                     | 4-7 years        |
| American         | short and silky                     | 4-7 years        |
| Sheltie          | short on the head, long on the body | 4-7 years        |

What's interesting, guinea pigs don't always function according to the math laws we normally know. A simple example is when they reproduce:

`1 + 1 = 3`

Saying that, it's worth remembering that two guinea pigs in one cage can result in more than just two pigs.
