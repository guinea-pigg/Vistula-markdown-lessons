## Chapter 2. Why having a guinea pig is not an easy task

Guinea pigs are very fragile animals and it's not always easy to notice their health problems from the very beginning.

What health issues can they have?

* Problems with teeth
* Problems with fur and skin
* Digestive issues
* Parasites
* Flu or runny nose
* Conjungtivitis

That's why it is always important to observe your guinea pigs and weigh them regularly! :)
